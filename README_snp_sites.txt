Directory Contents:

    - execute_snp_sites.slurm       ==  SLURM script to call "run_snpsites.py"
    - ns_prot_mutS.fasta            ==  FASTA protein alignment containing only SNPs (reference 'snp-sites' documentation) from "subset_900_ns_protein_mutS.faa" below
    - ns_prot_mutS.forMesquite.tsv  ==  tab-separated matrix of characters and states formatted (hopefully) for Mesquite (rows are sequences/end nodes, columns are characters)
    - ns_prot_mutS.original.tsv     ==  tab-separated matrix of characters and states formatted for human eyes (same as above, but including column names)
        --  columns are (in order from left to right):
            * "asm_acc" == sequence identifier (no underscores)
            * "seq_str" == sequence (amino acid) as a string (generated by 'snp-sites' from a longer set of aligned input sequences)
            * "snp_grp" == SNP pattern group identifier (either useful as a Mesquite categorical character or integer identifier)
            * "snp_var" == total number of SNPs per each sequence that differ from the most commonly observed bases at all positions of the sequence (continuous/count character)
            * "pos_###" == all other columns until the final column represent positions (in the original alignment processed by 'snp-sites') and indicate the binary presence/absence of a base identical to that of the most commonly observed base at that specific position
            * "MDR_bin" == final column is binary presence/absence of a multidrug resistance (MDR) genotype, as defined by resistance to 3 or more classes of tested drugs by CDC NARMS at CLSI standards
    - ns_prot_mutS.original.aa_sequence.tsv         ==  tab-separated matrix of ONLY the amino acid sequence formatted for human eyes (subset from original above, but including column names)
    - ns_prot_mutS.original.binary_chars.tsv        ==  tab-separated matrix of ONLY binary characters and states formatted for human eyes (subset from original above, but including column names)
    - ns_prot_mutS.original.categorical_chars.tsv   ==  tab-separated matrix of ONLY categorical characters and states formatted for human eyes (subset from original above, but including column names)
    - ns_prot_mutS.original.continuous_chars.tsv    ==  tab-separated matrix of ONLY continuous characters and states formatted for human eyes (subset from original above, but including column names)
    - ns_prot_mutS.phy              ==  relaxed Phylip format protein alignment containing only SNPs (reference 'snp-sites' documentation)
    - ns_prot_mutS.SNPmatrix.ftr    ==  feather format SNP matrix
    - ns_prot_mutS.SNPmatrix.tsv    ==  tab-separated SNP matrix
    - ns_prot_mutS.vcf              ==  variant call format file of SNP data (reference 'snp-sites' documentation)
    - run_snpsites.py               ==  script to call 'snp-sites' as well as processing outputs for Mesquite and creating SNP matrices
    - snpsites_3348834.out          ==  outputs from the SLURM job
    - subset_900_no_split_core_and_soft_core.ftr    ==  feather format pandas dataframe containing gene presence/absence information for the "core" and "soft core" segments of the pangenome calculated by Roary (https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/)
    - subset_900_ns_protein_mutS.faa                ==  FASTA protein (aligned) translations from loci annotated with the "mutS" gene name key word on the original nucleotide sequences; used as input for "run_snpsites.py"
